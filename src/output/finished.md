Initiated and developed a new Python utility, Pacetype, focusing on text automation and cross-application compatibility through clipboard interaction. This involved setting up the project structure, implementing core functionality across several iterations (v0.1.0 to v0.3.0), and refining the approach for robust character-by-character typing simulation.

Focused on improving project clarity and maintainability through documentation updates and refinements across a utility library (talktollm) and personal repositories.
